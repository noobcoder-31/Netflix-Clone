It provides an interactive and engaging user interface where users can select their answers and receive instant feedback on their performance.

## Features

-Randomized questions: The questions are randomized each time the quiz is taken, providing a different order of questions to enhance the user experience.
-Immediate feedback: After selecting an answer, users receive immediate feedback on whether their answer was correct or incorrect.
-Score tracking: The app keeps track of the user's score, displaying the total number of correct answers at the end of the quiz.

##File Structure
-index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the quiz app user interface.

-js/script.js: The JavaScript file that implements the logic and functionality of the quiz app.
